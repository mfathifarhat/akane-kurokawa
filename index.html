					<p>
						Akane has blue-green eyes and midnight blue hair. She is
						163 cm tall.
						<br /><br />
						At the beginning of the story, her hair was short, above
						her shoulders. However, from the Tokyo Blade Arc
						onwards, her character began to appear with long hair,
						covering almost half of her back.
						<br /><br />
						She is considered to be very beautiful by several other
						characters, such as
						<b class="font-manrope-bold">Ruby Hoshino</b>,
						<b class="font-manrope-bold">Abiko Samejima</b>,
						<b class="font-manrope-bold">Yoriko Kichijouji</b>, and

					<h2 class="text-2xl font-manrope-bold mb-4">Personality</h2>
					<p>
						During the beginning of the reality dating show
						<b class="font-manrope-bold">LoveforReal</b>, Akane was
						presented as a shy and reserved girl, which caused her
						to have a lot of trouble standing out on the show and
						many questioned whether she was a real actress. Soon
						after, it was revealed that Akane is out of her element
						if she does not have clear instructions on which
						character to play and, given the nature of a reality
						show, the lack of a script did not allow her to exploit
						her full potential. <br /><br />
						MEM-cho and Yuki, other co-stars of the show and Akane's
						friends, suggested she create a character of her own to
						play on the show to protect herself from criticism. When
						Akane wondered what kind of character to play, the girls
						pressed Aqua to reveal his ideal girl. Aqua, without
						much thought, ended up describing Ai. Her friends
						encouraged Akane to accept the challenge of playing
						Aqua's ideal girl and she, as a gesture of gratitude for
						helping her solve her scandal, accepted.
						<br /><br />
						Thanks to her studies in profiling, psychology and a
						natural talent for understanding characters, Akane
						managed to play the legendary idol Ai Hoshino to
						perfection.
						<br /><br />
						She is very hard-working and determined with every job
						she gets. When looking to take on a role, she makes sure
						to study and understand the character doing a complete
						background, to the point she plays it perfectly. She has
						been described by many as a genius actress despite being
						very young.
						<br /><br />
						During the Tokyo Blade arc, the complex and fascinating
						character that is Akane was explored in depth. Thanks to
						her intelligence and incredible investigative skills,
						she was able to deduce that Aqua and Ruby were Ai's
						children, a secret that no one had been able to discover
						for over 15 years.
						<br /><br />
						Akane is also a highly empathetic person who cares
						deeply for others. When she discovered that Ai was
						Aqua's mother, Akane hugged him to comfort him,
						realizing how terribly lonely it has been for Aqua to
						carry that secret and pain. Akane's sweet and gentle
						side should not be mistaken for naivety. When Aqua
						confessed to her that he became an actor to get close to
						and kill someone in the entertainment industry, Akane
						did not judge him. Instead, she offered Aqua to be his
						ally and help him kill that person, as she knew they
						were Aqua's mother's killer and didn't want him to be
						alone in his mission anymore.
						<br /><br />
						When they officially began dating, Akane became much
						more open in asking Aqua to spoil her after a busy day
						and appreciated him for all the small actions he made to
						show his feelings. For instance, Aqua would wait for her
						outside her workplace and reply to her texts as soon as
						possible, while never failing to praise her for her hard
						work. All these small actions made her feel grateful and
						satisfied.
						<br /><br />
						After her break up with Aqua, Akane does not hesitate to
						keep an eye on him in case he tried to kill Hikaru. She
						still cares for Aqua despite everything he put her
						through, and does not want him to go down a destructive
						path that would negatively affect him and his loved
						ones.

						Skills & Talents
					</h2>
					<p>
						Akane is a talented actress who is noted to be the
						immersive type of actor who get into her roles, which
						indicates she specializes in method acting. This is
						clearly demonstrated after she decides play the role of
						Ai Hoshino during the later portions of LoveforReal.
						After intense studying, Akane is able to replicate Ai's
						demeanor fastidiously (from her mannerisms, speech
						patterns, and even thought processes), so much so that
						she effectively bewitched Aqua and was capable of
						triggering thoughts of Ai in others immediately after
						looking at her. Through her research, she was able to
						accurately deduce that Ai's situation at the time.
						<br /><br />
						Akane is also very observant, as shown after seeing a
						video of kid Aqua Hoshino, she can tell that he was not
						putting his soul into his performance but just reciting
						the lines. This ability is not limited to her studying
						her roles, as she is able to use the same skills to make
						deductions, for instance, she is able to piece together
						Aqua's relationship with his late mother upon receiving
						little details surrounding his past.
						<br /><br />
						However, her preference for method acting does have its
						limitations such as during the stage adaption of Tokyo
						Blade. Early on, due to the changes made to her
						character in the script and with little to draw from the
						source material, she has problems getting immersed into
						her character.
						<br /><br />
						Akane is also an accomplished cook, capable of
						concocting a full-course savory dinner, for which Taishi
						Gotanda's mother commented to Aqua that 'this one's a
						keeper'. She gained these skills after attending cooking
						courses with her mother and cooking at home.
